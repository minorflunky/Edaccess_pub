# Update bot
A telegram bot that can update users on updates to a google spreadsheet

**requires a telegram API key and google spreadsheets API JSON credentials file.**

to use please edit the python file with your own API key and add your google JSON file to the working directory. Failure to do so will result in the script not working!

To send the notification to user about an update just write "send" into the A1 cell of your spreadsheet,
once the text dissapears the messages are sent.
